## Assignment Overview

This take-home assignment consists of two main tasks: building a chat interface and a double vertical bar chart for data visualization, using the following stack:

- **React.js**
- **MUI (Material-UI)**
- **Context API**
- **Hooks**
- **Axios**
- **Apache ECharts**

### Design:

Please follow the design provided in the [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/YVjXH0HdWwnBlXv9mPw9zr/Pharus---Front-End-take-home-assignment?node-id=0-1&node-type=canvas&t=jLJMey0jOisCweC9-0) and ensure the UI is responsive. The smallest screen size should be a landscape iPad.

## Task 1: Chat Interface

### Location:

The chat interface should be located on the right side of the view.

### Functionalities:

- When a message is sent, the chat should auto-populate a response using a random text generator API.
- The chat interface can be collapsed by clicking the “X” button in the top right corner.
- The chat should be hidden initially and revealed by clicking a purple button in the bottom right corner.
- Chat history should be saved in the session, and should include:
  - Message
  - User who sent the message
  - Timestamp

### Design Details:

- The buttons on top of the chat interface are decorative, except the “X” button which collapses the chat.

## Task 2: Double Vertical Bar Chart

### Data Source:

The data should be fetched from an API.

### Functionalities:

- Create a double vertical bar chart to display the fetched data.
- When hovering over a bar:
  - Display the data in a tooltip (use default EChart tooltip).
  - Reduce the transparency of other bars to 80%, highlighting the hovered bar.
- Display a large number above the chart, representing the total revenue from all periods combined.

## Additional Tasks

- **Context Management:**  
  Implement two separate contexts:

  - `Chart.context`
  - `Chat.context`

- **State Management:**  
  Use React Hooks for managing states effectively across the application.

We’re excited to see your work!
